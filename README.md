# anonymize-gpx

Remove extra information from GPX files to make sharing them safer.

## How to use

- Add GPX files to `raw`
- Run `make` to process the files
- Get processed GPX files from `anonymized`

Optionally:

- check `logs` to see the steps
- look at maps in `raw/maps` and `anonymized/maps`
