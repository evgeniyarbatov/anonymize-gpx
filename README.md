# anonymize-gpx

Remove extra information from GPX files to make sharing them safer.

## How to use

- Edit `SRC_DIR` in `Makefile` to point to GPX files
- Run `make` to process the files
- Get processed GPX files from `anonymized`

Optionally:

- check `logs` to see the steps
- look at maps in `anonymized/maps`
